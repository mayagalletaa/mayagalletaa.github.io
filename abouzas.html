    <p2>Dr. Arturo Bouzas obtained his B.A. in Psychology at UNAM in 1967. He has an M.S. in Clinical Psychology from the State University of New York at Stony Brook, <br>
         where he worked in Howard Rachlin's laboratory, with Leonard Green and Gene Heyman. During that time, his interests shifted from the clinical to the experimental area. <br>
          He obtained his PhD in Experimental Psychology from Harvard University in 1976, for his work on contingencies in instrumental behavior, which he performed at the <br>
          Pigeon Lab, advised by Dr. Richard Herrnstein. After completing his PhD, his interest in the biological processes of behaviour directed him to a post doctoral position <br>
          in animal behaviour at Toronto University (1977-1978) where he stayed as associate researcher until 1980. <br>
          Upon returning to Mexico, he incorporated as a faculty member at the School of Psychology at UNAM, <br>
          which he directed from 1997 to 2001. Afterwards, he was a visiting professor at the University of California, San Diego. <br>
          He is currently a full-time tenured professor, part of the National System of Researchers (second level) <br>
          and currently holds the Ezequiel A. Chavez special chair.
